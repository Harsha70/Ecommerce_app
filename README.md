After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!


# After you fork and clone:

## Install dependencies

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.
